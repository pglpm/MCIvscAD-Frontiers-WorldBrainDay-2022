\section{}

Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment have an increased risk of a trajectory toward Alzheimer's Disease. Early identification of patients with a high risk of Alzheimer's Disease is essential to provide treatment before the disease is well-established in the brain. great importance to study how well different kinds of predictors
%-- from neuropsychological examinations to advanced brain-imaging techniques -- 
allow us to prognose a trajectory from Mild Cognitive Impairment towards Alzheimer's Disease in an individual patient.

But more is needed for a personalized approach to prognosis, prevention, and treatment, than just the obvious requirement that prognoses be as best as they can be for each patient. Several situational elements that can be different from patient to patient must be accounted for:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{kinds} of clinical data and evidence available for prognosis;
\item the \emph{outcomes} of the same kind of clinical data and evidence;
\item the kinds of treatment or prevention strategies available, owing to different additional medical factors such as physical disabilities, different attitudes toward life, different family networks and possibilities of familial support, different economic means;
\item the advantages and disadvantages, benefits and costs of the same kinds of treatment or prevention strategies; the patient has a major role in the quantification of such benefits and costs;
\item finally, the initial evaluation by the clinician -- which often relies on too subtle clues (family history, regional history, previous case experience) to be considered as measurable data.
\end{itemize}
Statistical decision theory is the normative quantification framework that takes into account these fundamental differences. Medicine has the distinction of having been one of the first fields to adopt this framework, exemplified in brilliant old and new textbooks on clinical decision-making.

Clinical decision-making makes allowance for these differences among patients through two requirements. First, the quantification of prognostic evidence on one side, and of benefits and costs of treatments and prevention strategies on the other, must be clearly separated and handled in a modular way. Two patients can have the same prognostic evidence and yet very different prevention options. Second, the quantification of independent prognostic evidence ought to be in the form of \emph{likelihoods about the health condition} (or equivalently of likelihood ratios, in a binary case), that is, of the probabilities of the observed test outcomes given the hypothesized health conditions. Likelihoods from independent clinical tests and predictors can then be combined with a simple multiplication; for one patient, we could have three kinds of predictor available; for another, we could have five. The clinician's pre-test assessment is included in the form of a probability. These patient-dependent probabilities are combined with the patient-dependent costs and benefits of treatment or prevention to arrive at the best course of action for that patient. The main result underlying statistical decision theory is that decision-making \emph{must} take this particular mathematical form in order to be optimal and logically consistent.

The present work investigates the prognostic power of a set of neuropsychological and Magnetic Resonance Imaging examinations, demographic data, and genetic information about Apolipoprotein-E4The present work investigates the prognostic power of a set of neuropsychological and Magnetic Resonance Imaging examinations, demographic data, and genetic information about Apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE) status, for the prediction of the onset of Alzheimer's Disease in patients defined as mildly cognitively impaired at a baseline examination. The longitudinal data used come from the ADNI database.

 (APOE) status, for the prediction of the onset of Alzheimer's disease in patients defined as mildly cognitively impaired at a baseline examination. The longitudinal data used come from the ADNI database.

The prognostic power of these predictors is quantified in the form of a combined likelihood for the onset of Alzheimer's disease. As a hypothetical example application of personalized clinical decision making, three patient cases are considered where a clinician starts with prognostic uncertainties, possibly coming from other tests, of 50\%/50\%, 25\%/75\%, 75\%/25\%. It is shown how these pre-test probabilities are changed by the predictors. \mynotew{update this}

\mynotew{rewrite following} This quantification also allows us to rank the relative prognostic power of the predictors. It is found that several neuropsychological examinations have the highest prognostic power, much higher than the genetic and imaging-derived predictors included in the present set.

Several additional advantages of this quantification framework are also exemplified and discussed in the present work:
\begin{itemize}
\item missing data are automatically handled, and results having partial data are not discarded; this quantification, therefore, also accounts for patient-dependent availability of \emph{non-independent} predictors;
\item no modelling assumptions (e.g.,\ linearity, gaussianity, functional dependence) are made;
\item the prognostic power obtained is intrinsic to the predictors, that is, it is a bound for \emph{any} prognostic algorithm;
\item variability ranges of the results owing to the finite size of the sample data are automatically quantified.
\item the values obtained, being probabilities, are more easily interpretable than scores of various kinds.
\end{itemize}


%Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the most common type of dementia. The disease is characterized by an insidious onset caused by neurodegenerative processes, which lead to progressive loss of cognitive and functional abilities. Alongside the devastating personal consequences AD has on those affected and their caregivers, economical costs related to the disease are massive.
% 
% One of the difficulties for successful treatment of AD is the fact that its pathological hallmarks tend to be established in the brain decades prior to the time a person's cognitive and functional impairments are severe enough to get medical attention. Management of known risk factors for AD (e.g., high blood pressure and diabetes) is therefore emphasized. Recent studies point towards promising life-style interventions reducing AD-pathology and neurodegeneration and delaying symptom-onset. Much effort is therefore put into early identification and treatment of patients in the prodromal phase of the disease. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has become a diagnostic concept to describe this phase. Individuals falling within this diagnostic category show a cognitive decline greater than expected in normal cognitive aging, but still not with the severity of functional impairment characterizing those with dementia.

Meet Olivia, Ariel, Bianca, Curtis.\footnote{Fictive characters; any reference to real persons is purely coincidental}
% names from Shakespeare's plays
These four persons don't know each other, but they have something in common: they all suffer from a mild form of cognitive impairment, and are afraid that their impairment will turn into Alzheimer's Disease within a couple of years. In fact, this is why they recently underwent some clinical analyses and cognitive tests. Today they received the results of their analyses. From these results, available clinical statistical data, and other relevant information, their clinician will assess their risk of developing Alzheimer. The clinician and each patient will then decide among a set of possible preventive treatments.

Besides this shared condition and worry, these patients have other things in common -- but also some differences. Let's take Olivia as reference and list the similarities and difference between her and the other three:
\begin{itemize}
\item Olivia and Ariel turn out to have exactly identical clinical results and age. They would also get similar benefits from the available preventive-treatment options. Ariel, however, comes from a different geographical region from Olivia, where the conversion rate from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer is lower: about 30\%, whereas in Olivia's it is around 45\% \citep{petersenetal1999} Moreover there is no history of Alzheimer's Disease in Ariel's family.
\item Olivia and Bianca also have exactly the same clinical results and age. They come from the same geographical region and have very similar family histories. In fact we shall see that they have the same probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. Bianca, however, suffers from several allergies and additional clinical conditions that would render some of the preventive options less beneficial to her.
\item Olivia and Curtis have different clinical results -- in particular, Olivia has the risky Apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE4) allele \citep{liuetal2013} whereas Curtis hasn't -- and age, Olivia being more than 20 years older than Curtis. But they otherwise come from the same geographical region, have very similar family histories, and would get similar benefits from the preventive options.
\end{itemize}

We can categorize these differences as \enquote{difference in auxiliary information} (Olivia and Ariel), \enquote{difference in preventive benefits} (Olivia and Bianca), \enquote{difference in clinical factors} (Olivia and Curtis). Figure~\ref{fig:OABC} summarizes the similarity and differences between Olivia and the other three patients. Table~\ref{tab:patients_data} reports the clinical results and demographic data common to Olivia, Ariel, Bianca, as well as those of Curtis \mynotew{need to explain the variates and refer to \citep{ryeetal2022}}.

\medskip

Considering the similarities and differences among these patients, which treatments are optimal and should prescribed to them?

\medskip

Our main purpose in the present work is to illustrate, using the four fictitious patients above as example, how this clinical decision-making problem can today be solved methodically, exactly, and at low computational cost, when the available prognostic clinical information involves one-dimensional or categorical variates such as those listed in table~\ref{tab:patients_data}. The solution method integrates available clinical statistical data with each new patient's unique combination of clinical results, auxiliary information, and treatment benefits. % It is therefore the staple method for personalized prognosis, diagnosis, treatment.

In our example we shall find that -- despite the many factors in common among our four patients, even despite the identical clinical results for Olivia, Ariel, Bianca, and despite the identical probability of conversion for Olivia and Bianca -- \emph{the optimal treatment option for each patient is different from those for the other three}. This result exemplifies the importance of differences among patients with regard to clinical results, auxiliary information, or preventive benefits.

The method used is none other than decision theory, the combination of probability theory and utility theory \citep{vonneumannetal1944_r1955,raiffaetal1961_r2000,raiffa1968_r1970,berger1980_r1985,jaynes1994_r2003}. Medicine has the distinction of having been one of the first fields to adopt it \citep{ledleyetal1959}, with old and new brilliant textbooks \citep{weinsteinetal1980,soxetal1988_r2013,huninketal2001_r2014} that explain and exemplify its application.

Decision theory is also the normative foundation for the construction of an Artificial Intelligence agent capable of rational inference and decision making \citetext{\citealp[\chap~IV]{russelletal1995_r2022}; \citealp[\chaps~1--2]{jaynes1994_r2003}}. The present method can therefore be seen as the application of an \emph{ideal machine-learning algorithm}. \enquote{Ideal} in the sense of being free from approximations, special modelling assumptions, and limitations in its informational output; not in the sense of being impracticable. Another important point of the present work, indeed, is to show that \emph{for some kinds of dataset} such ideal machine-learning algorithm is a reality. It is preferable to popular algorithms such as neural networks, random forests, support-vector machines, which are unsuited to clinical decision-making problems owing to their output limitations. We discuss this matter further in \sect\mynotew{***}.

\mynotep{Add other advantages of this exact approach:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it does not make assumptions, besides natural assumption of smoothness of full-population frequency distribution
  \item can be used with partially missing clinical data
  \item can be used with binary or continuous predictands
  \item it tells us the maximum predictive power of the predictors
  \item it quantifies how prediction could change if we had more sample data
  \item it can be applied on-the-fly to each new patient

\label{sec:example}

\mynotez{It may be optimal to present the steps in reverse order: the last one explains the goal, and makes clear why the preceding steps are necessary.}

\subsection{Learning}
\label{sec:learning_step}

In the learning stage we infer the statistical relationships of a large population of which our future patients can be considered members, at least in some respects. Such relationships will help us in our prognoses. The basic idea is intuitive. If a patient can be considered a member of this population, and if we knew the joint frequencies of all possible combinations of predictor and predictand values in such population -- and knew nothing else -- then we would say that the probability for the patient to have particular values is equal to the population frequency. Pure symmetry considerations lead to this intuitive result \citep[\sects~4.2--4.3]{definetti1930,dawid2013,bernardoetal1994_r2000}.

But it must be emphasized, and it is essential for our method, that it is \emph{not} necessary (and is seldom true) that a future patient be considered as a member of such a population \emph{in all respects}. A patient can be considered a member only \emph{conditionally} on particular variate values. We shall discuss this point with an example in \sect~\ref{sec:population_step}.

If the full statistics of such a population were known, our task would just be to \enquote{enumerate} rather than to \enquote{learn}. Learning comes into play because the full population is not known: we only have a sample from it.

The most we can do is therefore to assign a probability to each possible frequency distribution for the full population. The probability of a specific \enquote{candidate} frequency distribution is intuitively determined by two factors: (a) how well it fits the sample data, (b) how biologically or physically reasonable it is. Figure~\ref{fig:inferring_distribution} show a fictitious sample data and various candidate frequency distributions \mynotep{...}.

\mynotep{Some more intuition and details about the maths, principles, and relation to machine learning} \citep{dunsonetal2011,rossi2014,rasmussen1999}.

The core of our method is the computation of the probabilities of all possible frequency distributions for the full population. From it we obtain the joint probability distribution $\p(X,Y,Z,\dotsc)$ for all variates $X,Y,Z,\dotsc$ available in the dataset.

This is the maximal amount of information that it is possible to extract from our dataset. Indeed, from it we can quickly calculate any quantity searched by specific or approximate algorithms. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Conditional probability, \enquote{discriminative} algorithms:} if we are interested in the probability of $Z$ given $X,Y$, we calculate $\p(Z \| X,Y) \defd \p(X,Y,Z)/\sum_{Z}\p(X,Y,Z)$.
\item \emph{Conditional probability, \enquote{generative} algorithms:} if we are interested in the probability of $X,Y$ given $Z$, we calculate $\p(X,Y,Z) \defd \p(X,Y,Z)/\sum_{X,Y}\p(X,Y,Z)$.
\item \emph{Regression or classification:} if we are interested in the average value of $Z$ given $X,Y$, we calculate $\E(Z \| X,Y) \defd \sum_{Z}Z\,\p(Z\|X,Y)$. The \enquote{noise} around this average value is moreover given by $\p(Z-\E\|X,Y)$.
\item \emph{Functional regression:} if $Z$ turns out to be a function $f$ of $X,Y$, then the probability will be a delta distribution: $\p(Z\|X,Y) = \delt[Z-f(X,Y)]$.
\end{itemize}




For readers with an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, in the next two subsections we briefly discuss the differences between our ideal algorithm and two popular algorithms: neural networks and random forests. These subsections can otherwise be skipped \mynotew{maybe move to appendices}.

\subsubsection{Neural networks}
\label{sec:neural_nets}

Neural networks are based on the assumptions that there is a \emph{functional relationship} from the predictor

variables $X$ to the predictand variables $Y$, possibly contaminated by a little noise (typically further assumed of constant width). In other words, they try to infer functions, not frequency distributions. This is a very strong assumption, quite unrealistic for many kinds of variables considered in medicine. It can only be justified in the presence of informationally very rich predictors, such as images. In the frequency distribution depicted on the right, for example, a neural network could be acceptable to represent the range $X < 15$, but would be hopeless for $X > 17$. Neural networks, moreover, typically output only the expected value of the predictand, $\E(Y \| X)$, not the full conditional probability $\p(Y \| X)$. \mynotep{Add references and generalizations.}

We must remember that a function can always be represented by a probability distribution, but not vice versa.\footnote{The function $f\colon x \mapsto y=f(x)$ corresponds to the probability density $\p(y\|x) = \delt[y-f(x)]$, where $\delt$ is a delta distribution.} The ideal machine-learning algorithm used in the present work will therefore always recover a functional relationship, if there is one, including its noise distribution. Additionally it gives us the probability distribution $\p(X)$ for the predictand.

\subsubsection{Random forests}
\label{sec:random_forests}





\subsection{Population assessment}
\label{sec:population_step}

Let's clarify this with an example. In our dataset we observe a value $\texttt{GDS} = 1$ with a frequency of 32\% across all patients. Among the patients who later converted to \ad, the frequency is 36\%; whereas among those who remained with a stable \mci, the frequency is 28\%. Given a new patient, if we knew that

--- Luca, old pieces of text ---

Personalized diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention strategies must make allowance for several fundamental differences among patients:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{kinds} of clinical data and evidence available for diagnosis or prognosis can be different;
\item the \emph{values} of the same kind of clinical data and evidence can be different;
\item the kinds of treatment or prevention options can be different;
\item the advantages and disadvantages, benefits and costs of the same kinds of treatment or prevention can be different;
\item finally, the evaluation of the clinician -- which often relies on too subtle clues (family history, regional history, case experience) to be considered as measurable data -- can be different.
\end{itemize}

Is there really a methodological framework that can take all these differences into account? Yes, there is, and Medicine has the distinction of having been one of the first fields to adopt it \citep{ledleyetal1959}: Statistical Decision Theory. Its application in Medicine is explained and exemplified in several, brilliant, old and new textbooks \citep{weinsteinetal1980,soxetal1988_r2013,huninketal2001_r2014}. This theory has mathematical and logical foundations and its principles constitute indeed the foundations for the definition and realization of Artificial Intelligence \citep{russelletal1995_r2022}

The basics of clinical decision making \mynotew{..basics: each piece of evidence contributes with a likelihood or odds; they combine together and together with the clinician's pre-data evaluation. Then they are combined with the different benefits/costs of treatments or prevention strategies to find the optimal one. Decision trees can be necessary (but don't change this framework). Costs \& benefits are evaluated by clinician \& patient together.}
